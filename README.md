# Exploratory Data Analysis on Cardiotocographic (CTG) Data

## Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Cardiotocographic (CTG) dataset to analyze fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and uterine contraction features. The objective is to identify key indicators associated with fetal health status and understand patterns within clinical measurements.

Cardiotocography is widely used in obstetrics to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy and labor.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- Understand the structure and distribution of cardiotocographic features
- Identify missing values and data inconsistencies
- Analyze fetal heart rate characteristics
- Examine relationships between clinical features
- Generate insights related to fetal health classification

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains features extracted from Cardiotocography exams, including:

- Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)
- Accelerations
- Decelerations
- Uterine Contractions
- Variability Measures
- Histogram-based features
- Fetal health classification (Normal / Suspect / Pathological)

## Steps Performed

1. Data Inspection and Cleaning
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Univariate Analysis
4. Bivariate and Correlation Analysis
5. Visualization of Feature Distributions
6. Identification of Key Risk Indicators

---

## Key Insights

- Certain heart rate variability metrics show strong association with fetal health classification.
- Abnormal deceleration patterns are more frequent in pathological cases.
- Feature correlation analysis highlights important clinical indicators for fetal risk assessment.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

This exploratory analysis provides valuable insights into fetal heart rate behavior and associated clinical indicators. The findings help in understanding how different cardiotocographic features contribute to fetal health classification and support data-driven decision-making in healthcare analytics.
